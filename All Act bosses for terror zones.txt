Uniques take 1 
Each Champion takes 1 (not the "champion pack")
Bosses and Super Uniques take 1
Guarenteed Tile pack elites take 1

Can have less than the min amount if the density rolled EXTREMELY REALLY BAD
Can have more than the max if a "Champion Pack" was the last to spawn in (based on a 2 screen radius of your character's Location)
Can have more than max if a guarenteed elite tile pack spawns in afterwards
Can have more than max if Bosses or super uniques spawn in afterwards

When a unique has an aura upon loading in all monsters in range of the aura radius take a random aura for 1 tick and then adjust to what the unique actually has
