# Patch Notes
**How do I get the new patch?**
1. **Delete btdiablo.mpq folder**
2. **Paste New btdiablo.mpq folder**

# Mod specific rules
1. Here are the rules for BTDiablo! Do not do the following, these things are not intended and not part of the balance of the game.
2. Larzuk Socketing Amulets, Rings, Gloves, Belts and Boots. You need to corrupt these items in order to get sockets to these items.
3. Utilizing Charms with more than half your inventory (Only Top or Bottom allowed)
4. Using Multiple Unique Charms of the same type (Example: 2x Hellfire, 2x Gheed or 2x Anni)
5. Selling and then buying back stacked currency from vendors
6. â€œReorganizing" on controller to remove inventory debuffs
7. All of these exploits are possible due to prioritizing your QOL while being limited by softcode changes in D2R modding. 

## Charm inventory
- D2R provides limited modding capabilities, so some systems work by the word of honor.
  Here is a screenshot of how you should arrange your inventory, only utilizing the bottom(or top, if you want to).
![Image of of an okay inventory](./images/charmventory.png)

- Here is an example of what you should not do. Do not use your full inventory to fill it with charms.
